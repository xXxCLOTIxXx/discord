# **Event Handling and Command Creation**

UDISCORD allows you to easily handle events and create commands. Let's take a look at how to do this using the `Client` class.

---

### **1. Client Initialization and Login**

Before handling events, you need to initialize the client and log in.

```python
from udiscord import Client, EventType, Message

# Create a client instance
client = Client()

# Log in using email and password
client.login("email", "password")
```

---

### **2. Handling Events**

#### 2.1. Using a Decorator to Handle an Event

You can handle events by using the `@client.event()` decorator. For example, to handle the `MESSAGE_CREATE` event, you can use the following code:

```python
@client.event(EventType.MESSAGE_CREATE)
def on_message(event: Message):
    # Function that is triggered when a new message is created
    print("Message: ", event.content)
```

When a new message is created, this function will be called, and the content will be printed in the console.

#### 2.2. Using the `add_handler` Method for Handling Events

Another way to add an event handler is by using the `add_handler()` method. Here's an example:

```python
def on_message_handler(event: Message):
    # Event handler that prints the message content
    print("Message (via handler): ", event.content)

# Add the handler for the MESSAGE_CREATE event
client.add_handler(EventType.MESSAGE_CREATE, on_message_handler)
```

Now, when a new message is created, the `on_message_handler` function will be triggered.

#### 2.3. Event Types

UDISCORD supports a variety of event types. For example:

- `EventType.MESSAGE_CREATE` ‚Äî Handles new message creation events.
- `EventType.ANY` ‚Äî Handles any event (use with caution).

For a complete list of event types, refer to the Objects documentation.

### **3. Handling Commands**

UDISCORD allows you to create commands that users can trigger through messages.

#### 3.1. Using a Decorator to Create a Command

You can create a command using the `@client.command()` decorator. For example, to respond to the `!commands` or `/commands` command, use the following code:

```python
@client.command(["!commands", "/commands"])
def get_commands(message: Message):
    # The bot will reply saying it doesn't have commands
    client.send_message(message.channelId, "Sorry, I don't have commands :_(")
```

#### 3.2. Using the `add_command` Method to Create a Command

Alternatively, you can use the `add_command()` method:

```python
def get_commands_handler(message: Message):
    # Send a response to the command
    client.send_message(message.channelId, "Sorry, I don't have commands :_(")

# Register the command using add_command
client.add_command(["!commands", "/commands"], get_commands_handler)
```

---

### **4. Event Object Classes**

Each event type can return its own specific object class. These classes contain details and data relevant to the event. For example, the `MESSAGE_CREATE` event will return a `Message` object, which holds information about the message that was created.

For more information about the specific event object classes, refer to the Objects documentation.

Now you know how to handle events and create commands for your bot using UDISCORD. These tools will help you create dynamic and interactive Discord bots!
